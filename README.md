# Homework-1
In the index I modified the following:
FIRST I replaced line 29 with <section id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization">, to make it appear as lines 38, and 47, therefore allowing the link to work correctly.
In line 11 of the index, I replaced "div" with header in header class="header". This is telling us we have a header section here.
Line 26, I replaced "div" with "header", this is the end tag for the header section.
Line 28, added "main" to class="content", since this is a main section below.
Lines 31, 40, and 49, I added the article element to show article elements enclosed in the article tags.
I added </main> to line 56. This is the closing tag for the main section.
I added <aside class="benefits"> at line 57. Here will be the aside elements.
I added line breaks at lines 67, and 68 to make the aside column on the webpage fit appropriatly.
I added figure tags at lines 60, 71, and 83 to enclose the images on the webpage.
"footer" was added at line 91 as "footer class="footer"". This shows a footer is within this element.

In CSS I modified the following:
Line 89, I grouped .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, and .benefit-cost in the same code line, because they each had the same element properties as one another.
Line 94 I grouped .benefit-lead h3, .benefit-brand h3, and .benefit-cost h3, because they each also had the same element properties as one another.
Line 155 I grouped .search-engine-optimization h2, .online-reputation-management h2, and .social-media-marketing h2, beacuse they too, each had the same element properties as one another.
